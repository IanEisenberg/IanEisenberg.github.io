                                    <p style="color:white;">Psychological sciences have identified a wealth of cognitive processes and behavioral phenomena, yet struggle to produce cumulative knowledge. Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction, two issues we address by examining individual differences across an unprecedented range of behavioral tasks, self-report surveys, and real-world outcomes. We derive a cognitive ontology and evaluate the predictive power of many psychological measurements related to self-regulation. Though both tasks and surveys putatively measure self-regulation, they show little empirical relationship. Within tasks and surveys, however, the ontology reveals opportunities for theoretic synthesis and identifies stable individual traits. Additionally, surveys predict self-reported real-world outcomes while tasks largely do not. We conclude that data-driven ontologies lay the groundwork for a cumulative psychological science.</p>

                                    <p style="color:white;">The administration of behavioral and experimental paradigms for psychology research is hindered by lack of a coordinated effort to develop and deploy standardized paradigms. While several frameworks have provided infrastructure and methods for individual research groups to develop paradigms, missing is a coordinated effort to develop paradigms linked with a system to easily deploy them. This disorganization leads to redundancy in development, divergent implementations of conceptually identical tasks, disorganized and error-prone code lacking documentation, and difficulty in replication. The ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and neuroscience research highlights the urgency of this challenge: reproducible research in behavioral psychology is conditional on deployment of equivalent experiments. A large, accessible repository of experiments for researchers to develop collaboratively is most efficiently accomplished through an open source framework. Here we present the Experiment Factory, an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments. The modular infrastructure includes experiments, virtual machines for local or cloud deployment, and an application to drive these components and provide developers with functions and tools for further extension. We release this infrastructure with a deployment (http://www.expfactory.org) that researchers are currently using to run a set of over 80 standardized web-based experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. By providing open source tools for both deployment and development, this novel infrastructure holds promise to bring reproducibility to the administration of experiments, and accelerate scientific progress by providing a shared community resource of psychological paradigms.</p>

                                    <p style="color:white;">Pavlovian biases influence learning and decision making by intricately coupling reward seeking with action invigoration and punishment avoidance with action suppression. This bias is not always adaptive—it can often interfere with instrumental requirements. The prefrontal cortex is thought to help resolve such conflict between motivational systems, but the nature of this control process remains unknown. EEG recordings of midfrontal theta band power are sensitive to conflict and predictive of adaptive control over behavior, but it is not clear whether this signal reflects control over conflict between motivational systems. Here we used a task that orthogonalized action requirements and outcome valence while recording concurrent EEG in human participants. By applying a computational model of task performance, we derived parameters reflective of the latent influence of Pavlovian bias and how it was modulated by midfrontal theta power during motivational conflict. Between subjects, those who performed better under Pavlovian conflict exhibited higher midfrontal theta power. Within subjects, trial-to-trial variance in theta power was predictive of ability to overcome the influence of the Pavlovian bias, and this effect was most pronounced in subjects with higher midfrontal theta to conflict. These findings demonstrate that midfrontal theta is not only a sensitive index of prefrontal control, but it can also reflect the application of top-down control over instrumental processes.</p>

                                    <p style="color:white;">To act effectively in a complicated, uncertain world, people often rely on task-sets (TSs) that define action policies over a range of stimuli. Effectively selecting amongst TSs requires assessing their individual utility given the current world state. However, the world state is, in general, latent, stochastic, and time-varying, making TS selection a difficult inference for the agent. An open question is how observable environmental factors influence an actor's assessment of the world state and thus the selection of TSs. In this work, we designed a novel task in which probabilistic cues predict one of two TSs on a trial-by-trial basis. With this task, we investigate how people integrate multiple sources of probabilistic information in the service of TS selection. We show that when action feedback is unavailable, TS selection can be modeled as “biased Bayesian inference”, such that individuals participants differentially weight immediate cues over TS priors when inferring the latent world state. Additionally, using the model’s trial-bytrial posteriors over TSs, we calculate a measure of decision confidence and show that it inversely relates to reaction times. This work supports the hierarchical organization of decision-making by demonstrating that probabilistic evidence can be integrated in the service of higher-order decisions over TSs, subsequently simplifying lower-order action selection.</p>
